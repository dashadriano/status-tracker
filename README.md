# Status Tracker
Patient Status Tracker. Fully built on Java.
<br />
# Abstract
The Status Tracker is a basic Java program that takes into account the patients for a particular screening instancea and their corresponding status, either positive or negative.

The program aims to help mitigate confusion in screening processes such as those of COVID-19 screenings, visualizing the patients through a simple GUI for healthcare workers, allowing them to cross check against physical notes or documents. Through the use of basic programming concepts, the Status Tracker has a straightforward user-friendly GUI to aid healthcare workers regardless if they are tech-savvy or not. 

# How It Works
As a small scale project, Status Tracker only utilizes a single Java file. 

`statusTracker.java` is simple enough that no additional functions or methods were needed to run the program. Split up into their goals, the code observable in the main file is neatly labeled to indicate what process the code block that entails the comment does. These processes include the logic behind status toggling and their corresponding colors, as well as the application instantiation through specifying the dimensions of the frame for the app.

For a more in-depth look, view `statusTracker.java` for the code.

# How To Use
To use, ensure that Java is installed and download `statusTracker.java` from this repository. Double click `statusTracker.java`.

At start-up, Status Tracker presents a list of 10 names, all of which are initially empty with corresponding `null` labels for their status. The status for each name are toggled through corresponding button present in the same row. Easily editable, the list of names are text fields wherein names can easily be put, removed, or altered.
